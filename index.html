    Hello, my name is Ashley Olson, and I'm pursuing a degree in business analytics and information systems. As a student, I am looking for a suitable job that works with data trends and different important variables that help a business grow. I hope to find a company or field of data analysis that intrigues me yet also challenges me. I enjoy lots of different topics that I believe I can work with, but what I truly hope to find a job in would be dealing with interior design and real estate. <br>
    <br>
    - I have a certain admiration for design and comfort, especially when it comes to homes. I believe that with the knowledge and information I have and will recieve from my major, I will be able to apply technical and creative based skills to a project. Whether this be a corporate layout entailing a large space meant for minimal design and more proficiency, or residential that is meant to fit a families desires which ranges in creativity.
